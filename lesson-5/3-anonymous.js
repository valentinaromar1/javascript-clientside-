// Sometimes we just need to run a short code block in one place, and so we don't need a named FUNCTION. In this case, we can use an ANONYMOUS FUNCTION, which is a function that is defined without a name and is often used as a callback or event handler.
// STEP 5: Add a crash counter variable
let crashes = 0;
// STEP 1: Create an event handler to listen for collisions, and add an anonymous function to handle the event

    stopRoll();
